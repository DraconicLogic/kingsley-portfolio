## About



My name is Kingsley Onyensoh, hailing from Huddersfield, West Yorkshire, UK (We're right next to Leeds)<br/><br/> I've been a developer for about a year now. I first got into programming during a ICT course back at college. For some strange reason I took a ten year detour doing other stuff before I reunited with coding again. I decided to enrol on coding bootcamp and reignite my passion for telling a computer what to do. <br/><br/>
I'm currently working as a freelance developer designing software tools for use at my current employement<br/><br/>
Outside of development I enjoy training Mixed Martial Arts, going for walks, listening to podcasts(makes the chores fly by) and reading.
